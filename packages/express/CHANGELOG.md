## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Verify-before-sign learns the shapes a Tradecraft swap needs, and pins who owns
  what a transfer creates.

  - `allowRegistryOffer` (opt-in, never inferred from the relay) admits the DA
    Registry Utility two-step offer shape — `AllocationFactory_TransferInternal`
    plus exactly one `TransferOffer` create — which is how a registry transfer to a
    receiver with no preapproval settles, and therefore how a swap to a pool
    settles. Callers that do not opt in keep the strict behaviour byte for byte.
  - A party minted under a TRUSTED instrument admin's key-fingerprint namespace is
    admitted alongside the enumerated trusted parties. Registrars operate their
    tokens through such parties (onRails puts per-user identities inside otherwise
    ordinary holdings), and a relay cannot forge one.
  - Ownership is pinned separately from that trust: every registry `Holding` a
    transfer creates is either the receiver's delivery or the sender's change, and
    must name one of them. Without this the namespace admission alone would let a
    relay re-own the sender's change — everything the transfer did not send.
  - The accept path admits the value-less `ExecutedTransfer` receipt some registrar
    versions create, without relaxing the owner pin on the holding beside it.

  The merchant SDK READMEs document the payment header's real size: a server must
  accept at least 16 KiB end to end.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Ship the fixes the registry never got.

  Four packages carried changed code under a version number npm already had, so
  `changeset publish` skipped them silently and no consumer could ever receive the
  fix. Verified by unpacking the published tarballs and hashing every `dist/*.js`
  against the local build: core differs in 2 files, client in 1, express in 1,
  next in 1; ledger is byte-identical and needs nothing.

  **core** — the published 0.7.0 decoder reads protobuf tags and lengths with the
  64-bit varint reader. The bound that refuses an over-32-bit tag (`readVarint32`,
  `> 0xffffffff`) exists only in the working tree, and that module IS
  verify-before-sign: agent-wallet re-exports `assertPreparedTransferMatches` from
  here. A participant's `readRawVarint32` and protobufjs both truncate such a tag
  and parse the field, so bytes the agent's validator skips as an unknown field are
  fully effective on execute and covered by the hash it signs. Every payer
  installed from npm runs without that bound today.

  The published 0.7.0 also ships no `network-failure.js` at all, while express and
  next now import `connectionNeverEstablished` from it — so this bump is a
  prerequisite for publishing them, not an optional companion.

  **client** — the ambiguity fixes in `fetch.ts`: the guard ordered ahead of the
  retry-budget branch, and the machine-readable `PAYMENT_UNCONFIRMED` code.

  **express** — the payment gate now covers every spelling the router will serve:
  `baseUrl + path` as well as the mount-relative path, and both the app's own
  normalisation and the loosest one (an `express.Router()` does not inherit the
  app's `strict routing` / `case sensitive routing`). Each of those gaps served a
  paid resource for free, silently. The default redeemed store is now one per
  process rather than one per middleware instance, and a settle reported successful
  without a transaction id is refused rather than deduped under a shared empty key.

  **next** — the same unidentifiable-settle refusal, so the twins stay in step.
